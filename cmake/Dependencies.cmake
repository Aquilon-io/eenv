# Required third-party dependencies for the LIBRARY ITSELF, via find_package() only.
# This file must fail loudly ("Could NOT find X") rather than silently
# reaching out to the network — that's the whole point of preferring
# find_package() over FetchContent for anything but test-only tooling.
#
# eenv currently has no mandatory third-party dependencies.
# GoogleTest is handled separately in cmake/Testing.cmake, since it is a
# test-only dependency and the only place where a FetchContent fallback is allowed.
